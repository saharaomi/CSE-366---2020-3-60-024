This code sets up and trains an image classification model using the EfficientNetB0 architecture with TensorFlow and Keras. Below is a detailed report on each part of the code:
This section imports necessary libraries for image processing, model building, and training. TensorFlow's Keras API is used for all deep learning operations.
Here dimensions for the images are set to 224x224 pixels, which is a standard input size for EfficientNetB0. The batch size for training and validation is set to 32.
ImageDataGenerator: This generates batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation. It scales the pixel values of images to the range [0, 1] and applies random transformations such as shear, zoom, and horizontal flip.
train_generator and validation_generator: These create data generators for training and validation sets, respectively, with an 80-20 split.
This determines the number of training and validation samples by counting the filenames in the respective directories.
EfficientNetB0: Loads the EfficientNetB0 model pre-trained on ImageNet, excluding the top (final) layers.
Custom Layers: Adds a GlobalAveragePooling2D layer, a dense layer with 1024 units and ReLU activation, and a final dense layer with softmax activation for classification.
This freezes all layers in the EfficientNetB0 base model to retain the pre-trained weights and only trains the newly added top layers.
Trains the model on the training data for 10 epochs, using the validation data for validation at each epoch. The steps per epoch are calculated based on the number of training samples divided by the batch size.
This code successfully sets up an image classification task using the EfficientNetB0 architecture. It includes steps for data augmentation, model architecture definition, compiling, training, and evaluation. The use of pre-trained weights from EfficientNetB0 helps in leveraging transfer learning, which can significantly improve performance when working with smaller datasets. The final output provides an evaluation of the model's performance on the validation set.

Model:Mobilnet v2
These codes are for training a classification model using the MobileNetV2 architecture on a dataset of images. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries like os, numpy, and tensorflow.keras are imported. ImageDataGenerator is used for data augmentation, and MobileNetV2 is imported as the base model.

Data Generation: Image data generators are created for both training and validation sets. These generators will automatically load images from directories, apply specified augmentations, and yield batches of data during training.

Model Architecture: MobileNetV2 is used as the base model, with the pre-trained weights from ImageNet. A custom classification head is added on top of the base model. The base layers are frozen to prevent them from being trained.

Model Compilation: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Accuracy is chosen as the metric to monitor during training.

Model Training: The model is trained using the fit method. Training data is provided via the train_generator, and validation data via the validation_generator. The number of steps per epoch is calculated based on the number of samples and batch size.

Model Evaluation: Finally, the model is evaluated using the evaluate method on the validation data generator. The evaluation result, including loss and accuracy, is printed.

Overall, these codes set up a pipeline for training a MobileNetV2-based classification model on a dataset of images with data augmentation and validation. The model is trained for 10 epochs, and its performance is evaluated on the validation set.
